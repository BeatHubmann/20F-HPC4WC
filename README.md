## Course synopsis

State-of-the-art weather and climate simulations rely on large and complex software running on supercomputers. This course focuses on programming methods and tools for understanding, developing and optimizing the computational aspects of weather and climate models. Emphasis will be placed on the foundations of parallel computing, practical exercises and emerging trends such as heterogeneous comput


## Objective

After attending this course, students will be able to:
- understand a broad variety of high performance computing concepts relevant for weather and climate simulations
